= Setting up a Test Environment for RHEL Lightspeed Command-Line Assistant

To effectively demonstrate and practice using the RHEL Lightspeed Command-Line Assistant, it's essential to set up a test environment. This guide will walk you through the necessary steps to create a suitable testing environment.

## Prerequisites

- A Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) system with root access
- The command-line assistant enabled

## Step 1: Install the Command-Line Assistant

If you haven't already, install the command-line assistant powered by RHEL Lightspeed. You can follow the instructions in [Chapter 2: Installing the Command-Line Assistant Powered by RHEL Lightspeed](https://your-documentation-link/chapter-2-installing-the-command-line-assistant-powered-by-rhel-lightspeed).

## Step 2: Verify Installation

Ensure that the command-line assistant is correctly installed and functioning. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
c
```

If the assistant is installed and working, you should see a prompt indicating that it's ready to assist you.

## Step 3: Prepare a Sample Web Server Configuration

For this hands-on lab, we'll be working with the Apache HTTP Server (httpd). To create a test environment, follow these steps:

1. List the httpd package version installed on your system:

   ```bash
   sudo rpm -qa httpd
   ```

   You should see an output similar to this:

   ```
   httpd-2.4.62-2.fc40.x86_64
   ```

2. Display the content of the httpd.conf file:

   ```bash
   sudo cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
   ```

   This file contains the main configuration directives for the Apache HTTP Server.

3. Query all httpdq packages:

   ```bash
   sudo rpm -qa httpdq
   ```

   This step is to ensure that any related packages are installed and accounted for in your test environment.

4. Identify the ports on which the web server accepts incoming requests:

   ```bash
   cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf | grep Listen
   ```

   This command will display the ports configured for the web server.

## Step 4: Configure SELinux Contexts (if
